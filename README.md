# MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES-APPLIED-IN-PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE
Currently, it is relevant to optimize maintenance activities, because otherwise, it will represent an increase in production costs, due to unnecessary production stops. The assignment to perform maintenance is mainly caused by the wear of the components, which lead to the total failure of rotating machines. Given this, it is necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the production processes, in addition to creating maintenance histories and strategies to reduce the costs related to maintenance on rotating machines. Thus, the main objective of this work is to study a methodology to reduce the maintenance costs referenced for rotating machines. In order to solve this problem, a predictive maintenance model is presented. The predictive maintenance strategy aims to predict failures and then perform a maintenance activity before a break occurs. Therefore, it makes use of Machine Learning methods, such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest using a database of 100 machines to solve this problem. For validation purposes, methodological procedures are defined according to performance metrics, which will be able to compare machine learning methods capable of predicting failures in rotating machines.

In this repository it is possible to find the codes of the two Machine Learning techniques applied, as well as their database used.
